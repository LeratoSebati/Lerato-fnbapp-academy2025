                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear,
    is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative 
    of the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found
    in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South 
    Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and 
    large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm
    (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb). Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate
    brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than 
    their counterparts further south. These populations are possibly separate subspecies, but not all
    researchers accept this.</p>
     <p>The word "koala" comes from the Dharug gula, meaning 'no water'. Although the vowel "u" was 
    originally written in the English orthography as "oo" (in spellings such as coola or koolah—two
    syllables), the spelling for that sound later became "oa"; the word is now pronounced in three
    syllables (ko-a-la) possibly in error based on that new spelling.[4] Another hypothesis is that 
    "koala" was an aboriginal name from the Hawkesbury River district near Sydney.</p>
   <p>The koala's generic name, Phascolarctos, is derived from the Greek words φάσκωλος (phaskolos)
    'pouch' and ἄρκτος (arktos) 'bear'. The specific name, cinereus, is Latin for 'ash coloured'</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
